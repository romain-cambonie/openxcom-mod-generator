        "shaped by the cold, ruthless Arctic."
        "Attire and Equipment: Her attire combines functionality with a touch of brutality â€“ a sleek, black chest armor that "
        "bulges with the strength of her physique, complemented by large shoulder pads. Her arms are covered with highly "

        "Artistic Style and Composition: The portrait should capture her commanding presence amidst this desolate backdrop. "
        "The composition should be dynamic, focusing on her from a slightly low angle to emphasize her dominance. The color "
        "palette should be a blend of cold metallic shades and warmer tones from her leather armor, creating a vivid contrast "
        "that underscores her determination and grit. The lighting should be dramatic, highlighting her features and the "
        "textures of her gear, enhancing the overall cyberpunk aesthetic."
